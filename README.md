###    User stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.

### Usage :
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

### Hint:
* To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
